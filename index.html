            <h2>Introduction to Leopard Geckos</h2>
            <p>Leopard geckos are small, nocturnal, ground-dwelling lizards native to the rocky grasslands and deserts of Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Nepal. They are popular pets due to their docile nature and relatively simple care requirements.</p>

            <h2>Housing and Enclosure Setup</h2>
            <p>A 10-20 gallon tank is sufficient for a single leopard gecko. The enclosure should have a secure lid and adequate ventilation. Provide a temperature gradient with a warm side (88-92°F) and a cool side (75-80°F). A heat mat is a good source of belly heat. Include at least two hides (one warm, one cool) and a moist hide to aid in shedding. Use a substrate like paper towels, reptile carpet, or slate tiles. Avoid sand, as it can cause impaction.</p>

            <h2>Diet and Feeding</h2>
            <p>Leopard geckos are insectivores. Their diet should consist of crickets, mealworms, and dubia roaches. Insects should be gut-loaded with nutritious food before being offered to the gecko. Dust insects with a calcium supplement with D3 at every other feeding and a multivitamin supplement once a week. Fresh, clean water should always be available in a shallow dish.</p>

            <h2>Health and Wellness</h2>
            <p>Common health issues include metabolic bone disease (MBD), impaction, and respiratory infections. MBD is caused by a lack of calcium and vitamin D3. Impaction is often caused by ingesting loose substrate. Respiratory infections can be caused by low temperatures or high humidity. Regular veterinary check-ups are recommended.</p>
